# UML-Activity-diagram_Taxi-service-app
An UML Activity diagram of a taxi service app.

## Short description of the diagram

The UML activity diagram represents the dynamic aspects of a system's behavior. This type of diagram focuses on modeling the system's activities. It allows for the modeling of processes at various levels of detail.

The example presents a model of the taxi service application system. It includes three actors: the system, the user, and the driver. To enhance clarity, the diagram has been simplified, representing the system as a single automated entity without differentiating individual actors. Additionally, this diagram does not include error modeling as part of its limitations.
